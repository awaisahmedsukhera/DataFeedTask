# DataFeedTask

## Overview

This python package reads data from desired source (i.e. xml) to desired destination (i.e. sqllite).

## Requirements


Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed before proceeding.

- **Python 3:** Visit [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install Python 3.
  
- **pip3:** If it's not included with your Python installation, you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

- **PyBuilder:** Install PyBuilder using pip3 by running the following command:

  ```bash
  pip3 install pybuilder
  pyb install
  pyb

### Setting up PYTHONPATH

If you encounter import issues, you can set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include the path to your modules. Open a terminal and run the following command to add the 'src/main/python' directory to your `PYTHONPATH`:
 ```bash
 export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/yourusername/DataFeedTask/src/main/python
 ```
Replace `/home/yourusername/DataFeedTask/src/main/python` with the actual path to your 'src/main/python' directory.
